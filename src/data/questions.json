These scientists think that anyone studying happiness should pay more {1:MC:~focus~concentration~=attention~regard} to people’s experiences at the time they occur, not afterwards.\r\nOther scientists say that we are actually {1:MC:~=made~built~created~developed} up of our memories. They suggest that studying moment-to-moment experiences at the time {1:MC:~sets~=puts~fixes~rests} too much emphasis on temporary pleasures, and that happiness goes {1:MC:~stronger~lower~=deeper~greater} than that. They identify three key {1:MC:~=ingredients~parts~factors~items} for happiness: pleasure, engagement (how involved we are with family, work, romance and hobbies) and meaning (how we use our personal strengths to achieve important {1:MC:~intentions~plans~marks~=goals}.

Maybe they just mistake swimmers for part of their group, which would mean that dolphins don’t have genuine feelings of kindness towards humans. {1:SA:=It} may be that their smiling appearance simply gives people the wrong idea.\r\n\r\n// Part 3: Word formation",

    "text": "[html]<p><i>You are going to read an article about a woman who tried out a new kind of food. Read the text once quickly and answer the first question below.</i></p>\r\n  <p>Last week, I posted a picture of my supper on Facebook. Never before has a post about a meal drawn so much <u>controversy</u> from friends. The reason? I was about to tuck into some Huel, a vegan powdered food that claims to contain everything the body needs, according to current government guidelines on <u>nutrition</u>.</p>\r\n  <p>This was on day 10 of my journey with Huel, the powdered food which has become something of a sensation. It sold out three times in the first month after its launch last year. Company founder Julian Hearn said his plan was not to replace food in our diets, but to offer a healthy, sustainable alternative to junk food and ready meals. After taking the stuff for three weeks it’s a concept I've surprised myself by buying into – and I’m not alone. Some 400,000 Huel meals have been sold since June, in more than 30 countries. Huel comes in a large, plain white bag with a scoop and instructions. One level scoop of Huel (38g) equates to 156 calories. You’re advised to use an online calorie counter to calculate how many calories you should be consuming. At 167 cm and 63 kg and with a very active lifestyle, I need 2,233 calories daily to maintain my weight. I began my adventure with Huel one busy evening when, <u>engrossed</u> in work, I didn’t want to stop to cook.</p>\r\n  <p>The instructions suggest adding some flavour when you start and to introduce Huel slowly. I blended three scoops with 550ml of water and a banana: a ‘meal’, according to the packet, and the equivalent of eating a sandwich. The first gulp of creamy, vanilla-tasting liquid seemed harmless, but the following sips got smaller as I <u>struggled</u> to swallow it and couldn’t finish, mainly because I found it so filling. Not eating felt strange but I went to bed feeling satisfied and with no ill effects. Ordinarily, I eat very healthy meals, so I notice when I’ve consumed any kind of junk but not with Huel, despite feeling rather worried when I looked at the lists on the label. The main ingredients are oats, pea protein, brown rice protein and flaxseeds followed by what looked like a load of chemicals. [line 38] According to Julian Hearn these provide vitamins and minerals.</p\r\n  <p>Over the first few days, I hated the sugary smell of Huel and its sweet taste, [line 40] but by the end of the week, I’d got the hang of it: one meal a day, best consumed for breakfast. I found it really useful during a busy working week. It was highly convenient having my dishwasher virtually unused and my rubbish bin empty. Besides, because I intentionally restricted my calorie intake to rid my body of some excess weight I’d put on over Christmas, by the end of the week I had lost 3 kilos.</p>\r\n  <p>Week two was harder. On two Huel meals a day I started to really miss eating. I love cooking and eating is a highly social occasion for me. But when I did sit down to a proper meal, I savoured every single mouthful. Huel had <u>heightened</u> my appreciation for food. Most encouragingly though, I was feeling great. There was no difference in energy levels at the gym and my body tolerated it well.</p>\r\n  <p>In week three, I managed two full days of only Huel before I broke. I missed mealtimes and the <u>therapy</u> of cooking after a long day. But even with the experiment over, I continued with one Huel meal a day – especially when on the run, which is exactly how the powder is meant to be used.</p>\r\n  <p>Ironically, if I’d posted a picture of a burger from a fast-food chain on my Facebook page, it would have attracted plenty of thumbs up – but it’s junk. Huel, in my opinion, is not.</p>",

When the American 90s rock band Pearl Jam put on a concert in the dried-up, baking-hot Coachella Valley in California, it was an attempt to prove that they could break away from the monopoly of the concert giant TicketMaster, who, they believed, was using its considerable power to exploit music fans by continually increasing prices. Their concert was well attended and inspired the idea for a future, more ambitious event. Naturally, nobody could have predicted quite how important Coachella would eventually become.</p> -> 4. The original inspiration of Coachella\r\n\t=<p>B. Six years later, in 1999, the same venue hosted its first weekend-long music festival. Although initially making a loss, this was blamed on the unbearably high temperatures and the lack of available campsite facilities. What's more, it took only a few more years until its quality line-ups, from small bands to headliners, were attracting worldwide attention.</p> -> 7. Overcoming problematic beginnings\r\n\t=<p>C. If one band is responsible for confirming Coachella's arrival on the world stage, it is Daft Punk's iconic appearance there in 2006.  As a direct result of the festival's success, promoters expanded it to a three-day event, and in 2009, Coachella presented its most mainstream line-up, including Paul McCartney, the Killers, and The Cure. The following year Jay-Z became the first rap headliner and by 2012 such was the popularity of Coachella that it had developed into two weekends of three-day shows.</p> -> 2. Getting bigger and better\r\n\t=<p>D. In an effort to attract America's impoverished younger generation to an expensive annual visit to the desert, the promoters made two clever decisions. One smart move was to get a much-missed band or singer such as Rage Against the Machine to reform every year. Most notable was a holographic representation of the late rapper 2Pac in 2012. ln a stroke of genius, they decided to cater for the section of the audience who adored the music that used to be labelled electronic and who flocked to dance in big tents to their favourite DJs.</p> -> 1. Appealing to the target market\r\n\t=<p>E. By keeping its cool musical reputation, the festival would go from strength to strength. In 2016, half a million fans bought their tickets in under 20 minutes, and each year around 100,000 attendees a day now splash out around $375 on admission. Of course, the costs don't stop there. It is now the most profitable festival in the world.</p> -> 6. A money-making success\r\n\t=<p> F. Just two hours from Los Angeles, Coachella swiftly became the place to see and be seen. The presence of models and other celebrities soon began to attract style bloggers, drawn by the fashion rather than the music. Which, in turn, has made Coachella irresistible to fashion houses, beauty companies and other lifestyle labels.</p> -> 5. A fashionable destination\r\n\t=<p>G. Although for several years luxury brands have been hosting free concerts and pool parties for invited guests and photographing Instagram stars modelling designer clothes, this has until recently been outside festival hours. As a result, they are now effectively separate events, to the point that 'No-chella' as it has become known, is, in the opinion of some, in danger of overshadowing the 'real' festival.</p>\\n<p>Coachella has certainly come a long way from the original anti-establishment Pearl Jam gig.</p> -> 3.

    "text": "<h4>A match made in heaven</h4>\r\n<p>Is there anything wrong with wanting to find a ‘soulmate’ - that one special person who will make the perfect partner? Many of us believe that this is the only kind of true love there is because we’ve been brought up on a diet of romantic pop songs and films that idealise love. We cling to the idea, even though we suspect it’s doomed to failure. After all, around 50 percent of marriages end in divorce in many western countries. So why is the soulmate myth so powerful? Maybe it’s because we don’t like thinking that life is messily random. Or we need a romantic way of describing intense physical attraction. Or maybe it’s just shorthand for the kind of overwhelming emotion we don’t quite understand.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout history, many great works of literature such as Shakespeare’s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> have been based on the idea of romantic love, as have popular works of contemporary fiction such as <i>One Day</i> and <i>Twilight</i>. This isn’t a preoccupation found only in Western cultures either. A Chinese story about lovers destined to be together, regardless of social class, background or geography, dates back to the ninth century. Many of these stories have tragic endings; <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> being a famous example.</p>\r\n<p>The founding father of romance is often thought to be the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato. But it was actually the Romantic poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who came up with the term ‘soulmate’, as we understand it today. ‘To be happy in married life ... you must have a soulmate,’ he said in a letter in 1822. This was an unconventional opinion, which probably seemed revolutionary at the time, but these days, searching for spiritual completion is the norm.</p>\r\n<p>Not everyone subscribes to this view, however. A recent study on attitudes to long-term relationships found that couples who have been together a long time are more likely to refer to each other as ‘best friends’ rather than ‘soulmates’, and are unconvinced by the representation of romance in popular culture. They know these over-idealised romances don’t bear any relation to reality - so they don’t take them seriously.</p>\r\n<p>A pragmatic approach to love would seem to give relationships a better chance of survival. Research carried out by a professor of social psychology at the University of Houston showed that people believing in romantic destiny tend to have relationships that are passionate but short-lived. Only perfection will do - if things go wrong, this can’t be ‘The One’. Research published by Prof. Spike Lee, of Toronto University, and Prof. Norbert Schwarz, of the University of Southern California, confirms these findings. ‘People who implicitly think of relationships as perfect unity between soulmates have worse relationships than people who implicitly think of relationships as a journey of growing and working things out.’</p>\r\n<p>Finding a partner can seem overwhelming if you’re convinced you’ve got to search the entire world for just one person, so these days many of us have come round to the idea that fate may need a helping hand. This is why one in five UK relationships starts online. As Lori Laius, of Telegraph Dating, says, ‘You’re using today’s technology to help you find someone special.’ This suits men in particular, who typically have always been more hard-headed about the possibility of finding a match made in heaven. And although meeting online doesn’t quite live up to the romantic ideal, it’s now just as normal as meeting someone at a party or at work.</p>",

    "text": "<h4>X-Men: The Real-life Superhumans</h4>\r\n<p><b>Disappointingly for comic-book fans, there is no equivalent to X-Men in the real world. But there ore o surprising number of people who - by way of genetic mutation - hove acquired abilities that could comfortably be classed as superhuman.</b></p>\r\n<h5>A. Liam Hoekstra</h5>\r\n<p>Born prematurely, it was feared that Liam Hoekstra would be in poor health as he grew up. If anything, the opposite was true and despite initial problems with his heart and kidneys, it was apparent by the age of only five months that Limn was developing superhuman strength. He was diagnosed with a rare condition characterised by an absence of myostati.n. This is a protein which regulates muscle development, a lack of which leads to the kind of physical attributes that athletes can only dream about: 40 percent more muscle than normal, breathtaking strength and speed and almost no body fat. It is possible that the myths about the Greek hero Hercules were based on individuals with this condition. There are no negative side-efef cts; the only possible drawback was that without adequate body fat, brain growth in childhood could be restricted. Thankfully, Liam seems unaffected. His condition is more than a medical rarity; it could help scientists unlock the secrets of muscle growth and deterioration and lead to new treatments for diseases which cause weakness, such as osteoporosis.</p>\r\n<h5>B. Wim Hof</h5>\r\n<p>One of the original characters in the <i>X-Men</i> was Bobby Drab:, otherwise known as Iceman. As far-fetched as it sounds, in the real world there is a real-life Iceman, called Wim Hof. He may not be able to turn everyday objects into ice, as Bobby Drake did, but he holds 20 world records related to resisting the cold, which he says is the result of meditation practices. Among Hof's achievements are standing submerged in an ice bath for one hour and 44 minutes and running a marathon in the Arctic Circle wearing only shorts. Over a period of 20 minutes in the ice bath his temperature and heart rate remained completely normal. Scientists have confirmed that Hof is indeed able to regulate his body functions; by controlling cell production he gains improved immunity and better cognitive performance. Hof believes the skill is attainable by anyone who can convince themselves they can do it.</p>\r\n<h5>C. Dean Karnazes</h5>\r\n<p>Dean Karnazes's muscles have extraordinary properties. Most people suffer intense fatigue and are forced to give up when too much exercising causes lactic acid to build up in their muscles. Not so Karnazes: his body clears the acid with such extraordinary efficiency that he can remain hydrated and functional for re1rnirkably long periods during feats of endurance. His 22-year career includes runmng 350 miles in 80 hours and 44 minutes without sleep, completing a 135-mile ultra-marathon in Death Valley, California, in temperatures of 49C and a marathon in each of the USA's 50 states on 50 consecutive days. Unaware of his 'gift' until he took part in a scientific study at the age of 30, he is convinced that there are people like him everywhere who have no idea they have this ability.</p>\r\n<h5>D. Isao Machii</h5>\r\n<p>The scientific world is totally confosed by lsao Machii, aJapanese practitioner of laido, the art of the samurai sword, who is the holder of several world records involving fast sword cuts. For one title he had to cut through a te1mis ball travelling at 440 miles per hour. His most impressive feat was when an airgun fired a 5mm plastic pellet at Maclm at a speed of 200mph. At this speed it is not likely that the human eye could track an object of this size and unimaginable that human reflexes could respond.Yet he was able to draw his sword and slice it in two when it was in mid­ air. A psychologist who observed the experiment said “He was expecting it before it happened - a unique form of anticipatory awareness, sort of like Spiderman.„</p>",
