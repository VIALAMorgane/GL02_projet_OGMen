We can all name celebrities who are keen users of social media and who we suspect have the following things in common: a desire to be noticed, a self-important view of themselves, superficial personalities and shameless self-publicity. In that sense, they are just like millions of their Facebook and Twitter fans around the world, except successful.</p>\r\n<p>Until the 90s, the media provided an escape from <u>reality</u> by transporting viewers to the fictional universe of situational comedy and soap operas. <b>[1]</b> It did this by broadcasting the allegedly genuine and ordinary lives of everyday people and making them into <u>cultural</u> blockbusters. However, in the past decade, social media appears to have enabled everybody to make their life public and be the star of their own 24/7 show.</p>\r\n<p>There are now many mega-successful apps and websites. <b>[2]</b> It all began with MySpace, a list of <u>hopeful</u> future pop stars and DJs. Then came Facebook, the <u>choice</u> of the average person. YouTube gave everybody their own TV channel, Blogger and Tumblr made us all creative writers. Twitter brought in loads of followers and LinkedIn encouraged us to give each other <u>approval</u> of our professional skills. Instagram made ‘selfie’ the word of the year, while Tinder and Snapchat made Facebook look <u>intellectual</u>.</p>\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, narcissism levels have been rising for decades. <b>[3]</b> At the same time, the advent of Facebook and Twitter has brought with it a steep decline in <u>generosity</u> and levels of sympathy. We are now more connected than ever, but also less interested in other people, except when it comes to finding out what they think about us. It is as if being closer to others made us more antisocial.</p>\r\n<p>Needless to say, most social media users are not narcissistic. Yet the more narcissistic you are, the heavier your social media use. Indeed, <u>scientific</u> studies have shown that the number of status updates, attractive selfies, followers and friends are all positively linked to narcissism. <b>[4]</b></p>\r\n<p>The big problem with the rise of digital narcissism is that it puts enormous pressure on people to reach <u>unachievable</u> goals, without necessarily putting in much effort. Wanting to be Beyoncé or Jay Z is hard enough already, but when you are not prepared to work hard to achieve it, you are better off just being less <u>ambitious</u>. Few things are more <u>destructive</u> than the <u>belief</u> that you have the right to something, combined with a lazy work ethic. Ultimately, online <u>evidence</u> of narcissism may be little more than a way of making up for a low and fragile self-esteem.<b> [5] </b>In this case, reality is misinterpreted and narcissistic fantasies are strengthened.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps it is time to turn social media into a <u>therapeutic</u> tool, at the service of the public and society. Examining the rise of narcissism could be done both at an individual and population level. <b>[6]</b> The aim of this would be to make users aware of their <u>excessive</u> self-<u>promotion</u>, uncontrollable self-love and even signal when an entire population might be at risk of becoming too self-obsessed for its own sake. Or is it too late?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n::U6 p62 Reading 2::[html]<b>Complete this sentence to summarise the writer’s main point.</b>\r\n<p>Socal media encourages people to...</p>{\r\n  ~get a false impression of the celebrities they follow.\r\n  ~have unrealistic hopes for their own futures.\r\n  ~=become too focused on the opinion others have of them.}",
